### Project Description: Optimized IP Allocation using Subnetting

In this project, I implemented an optimized IP allocation strategy using subnetting. The goal was to efficiently distribute IP addresses from the network subnet 192.168.10.0/24 across four subnets, tailored to the specific number of devices required in each network segment. The distributions are as follows:

- Subnet 1: 70 devices
- Subnet 2: 43 devices
- Subnet 3: 20 devices
- Subnet 4: 4 devices

Using PNetlab, I designed and tested the subnetting scheme, ensuring all requirements were met while maximizing the utilization of the available address space. This project demonstrates practical skills in network design, IP management, and subnetting techniques.
